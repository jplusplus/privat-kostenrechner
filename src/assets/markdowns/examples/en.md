## Example 1: Small car in the city

A small car which is mainly used in the city represents the ideal application case of a battery electric vehicle (BEV). Considering the typical driving distances in urban and suburban areas, the limited range of approx. 150 km is hardly significant and the battery can be recharged, for example, overnight at a simple wall box (3.7 kW) in the domestic garage. Furthermore, the driver of an electric car enjoys free access to any Low Emission Zone in the city and possibly also to special parking spaces in the city center. The exemplary calculation is based on an annual mileage of 9,000 km and a holding period of 8 years.

The fuel consumption of the gasoline-powered small car in Example 1 is increased by 10% (compared to the average consumption of small gasoline cars) because of the short distances in the city which are characterized by many acceleration and braking actions. The electricity consumption of the small electric car is not modified although it is expected to be below average (urban driving is characterized by low vehicle speeds and high energy recuperation due to braking – both effects reduce the electricity consumption of the car).

However, what to do if the distance to be travelled is longer than the range of the electric car? Especially in larger cities and their surrounding regions (for example, in tourist areas or along the motorway) an increasing network of public charging points is developing. Destinations that are even further away can be reached either by train or remote bus or by a "long-distance" car – on this occasion a rental car (that can be chosen specifically for each journey) can be a very good and economic alternative to a private car.

## Example 2: Plug-In Hybrid – the all-rounder

Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) combine the advantages of both automotive worlds: on short distances of up to 50 km they run quietly, locally free of emissions, energy- and cost-efficiently in electric mode. At the same time, the gasoline engine in the vehicle ensures the range and the long-distance reliability of conventional cars. However, these advantages from combining both powertrains are to be purchased by a higher vehicle price.

This example describes a large family car which is used for the daily commute to work as well as for longer journeys such as weekend trips, visits to friends and relatives and holiday journeys. The calculation is based on a holding period of 8 years and an annual mileage of 15,000 km, of which 70% (10,500 km) are driven electrically and 30% are powered by the combustion engine. The battery of the plug-in hybrid is recharged twice a day – at home as well as on the company's parking lot – in just 2-3 hours at a simple wallbox (3.7 kW).
