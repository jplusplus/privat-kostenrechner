## About

As a part of the Parallel Impact Research in the Showcase Programme, the VDE (Association for Electrical, Electronic & Information Technologies) commissioned Oeko-Institut e.V. to develop the online TCO calculator for commercial vehicles in 2015. 
In spring 2017 the online cost calculator was extended by a version for private car owners. This version is based on the same methodology as the calculator for commercial vehicles, however, it takes into account the differences concerning the acquisition and operation of privately registered cars. 
Background information on the calculator’s methodology and assumptions can be found in the documentation file (available in German language only).

Oeko-Institut e.V. developed the online TCO calculator’s methodology and calculation reasoning to accompany research within the ICT for Electric Mobility II programme, which was funded by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy. The methodology and results for additional vehicle categories can be found in the [final report]((https://www.oeko.de/fileadmin/oekodoc/Gesamtbericht-Wirtschaftlichkeit-von-Elektromobilitaet.pdf)) (in German language only).

The cost calculator was developed and implemented by [Journalism++](http://www.jplusplus.org/). 

### System requirements

The browsers are available for all popular operating systems (Windows 8 and higher, Mac OS 10.9 and higher, Ubuntu 12.04 and higher).
