    "welcome_description_1": "Out of more than 3 million new car registrations per year in Germany about 800,000 cars are attributed to corporate vehicle fleets – representing a huge potential for electromobility. Using electric vehicles in a corporate vehicle fleet offers several advantages compared to private use. Firstly, the restricted driving range is less problematic when there is the possibility to switch to other vehicles in the fleet. Furthermore, the charging facilities installed on the company premises can be used by several cars, which contributes to cost reduction. When the use of the vehicles is well planned and use conflicts are avoided, vehicle utilization and cost-effectiveness can be improved.",
    "welcome_description_2": "About 40% of all new electric cars are private vehicles. Although private users on average drive less kilometers per year and have less tax advantages compared to commercial users, they are increasingly ready to buy the new technology. Most private car owners also have the possibility to install a charging point at home which makes it easy to recharge the electric car overnight. ",

By using the online calculator you can analyze the costs and CO2 emissions associated with car driving. The approach of total cost analysis (TCO – Total Cost of Ownership) includes all cost factors, namely vehicle acquisition, charging infrastructure, costs for fuel and electric energy, vehicle maintenance, taxes, insurance and the residual value of the vehicles. For a start you can use plausible default values and for a more personal analysis you can modify many input variables according to your preferences.</p>",
